I'm the School Data Analyst for the <a href="https://www.floridaufsd.org/" title="Florida Union Free School District" target="_blank">Florida Union Free School District</a> in the village of Florida, New York. I'm grateful to play a role in shaping the future of many youths by leveraging my skills.

I'm excited to graduate from the <a href="https://www.newpaltz.edu/" title="SUNY New Paltz | the State University of New York at New Paltz" target="_blank">State University of New York at New Paltz</a> this spring. It’s been a long road to get here, and I’m looking forward to achieving what I set out to accomplish many years ago.

You’ll find me with my wife and son in my free time, walking with the dogs, enjoying music and food, and playing board games and video games.

I'd love to [hear from you](contact.qmd)!
