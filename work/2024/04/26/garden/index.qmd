## Planning For a Garden

I first heard about "digital gardens" during [Vicki Boykis's](https://vickiboykis.com/) [rstudio::global 2021 keynote entitled "Your Public Garden."](https://posit.co/resources/videos/your-public-garden/) During it, she discussed how it's important to build a digital garden as a way to take control of your online experience and create a more positive space. This approach intrigued me, so I wanted to learn more about it. [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) did an excellent job exploring how [digital gardens serve as personal knowledge management systems, allowing individuals to cultivate their thoughts and ideas in a non-linear format](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). There are many benefits to planting and tending to a digital garden, such as fostering creativity, enabling serendipitous discovery, and facilitating knowledge sharing. I found this concept delightful, so I planted my own digital garden.

Before this, I had a website I built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I liked that website. The design was a fork of [Simplefolio](https://github.com/cobiwave/simplefolio) by [Jacobo Martínez](https://github.com/cobiwave). I modified the theme's colors to be more purplish-blue than sea green, changed the font, and added links to my social networks and data analysis projects. It took a while to finish the site, and I wish I documented the process. It served me well when it went live in 2021. However, I started my [bachelor's in Business Analytics program](https://www.newpaltz.edu/schoolofbusiness/businessanalytics/) that year, and I started a new job on top of being a busy husband and father. Hence, the site has gone largely untouched since then. Earlier this year, however, I got the itch to rework my website. But what to do? I experimented with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) before settling on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as my platform of choice. But why Quarto?

## Why Quarto?

I'd love to jump into a list of well-thought-out reasons for using Quarto to plant the seeds of my digital garden [like Silvia Canelón did](https://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/#why-port-to-quarto). However, it really boiled down to inspiration, availability, and ease of use.

-   **Inspiration**: Upon searching for websites built using Quarto, I was inspired by the myriad of creatives using it to build not only websites but also communities, and I wanted to join the crowd.

-   **Availability**: Quarto was already available within [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), a tool I've used extensively since starting my bachelor's program.

-   **Ease of Use**: [Quarto required little more than a knowledge of RMarkdown to get started](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html). Since I already possessed that, the barrier to entry was low for me.

## Planting a Garden

Hopefully, I won’t regret this later. Still, I won’t detail how I planted my digital garden’s seeds. Instead, I'm going to list where I got my information and inspiration from:

-   [Jadey Ryan: Intermediate guide to publish a Quarto website with GitHub & Netlify](https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2023-11-19_publish-quarto-website/)
    -   This was my go-to resource while building my site. If you're interested in using Quarto to plant a digital garden, I highly recommend you start here. I did most of what Jadey outlined, with a few exceptions:
        -   I don't use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment. I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
        -   I didn't use [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).
        -   While I want my garden to be accessible to as many people as possible, I'm not using [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) to audit the accessibility.<br /><br />
-   [Marvin Schmitt: Create Your Website with Quarto: Complete Tutorial and Template](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/)
    -   I picked up a few tips and tricks here, mainly [on adding new pages](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/#adding-new-pages) and [deploying with GitHub Pages](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/#publishing-your-website-to-the-internet).<br /><br />
-   [Silvia Canelón](https://silviacanelon.com/)
    -   She inspired me to go repo-diving to learn how things were done on other people's sites, primarily how she built her [contact form](https://silviacanelon.com/contact)[^1].

[^1]: Silvia Canelón went repo-diving while working on her contact form and learned from [Tidy Tales'](https://tidytales.ca/) [About page](https://tidytales.ca/about/). I should probably update my source to reflect that.

-   [Samantha Csik: Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)
    -   I followed Sam's guidance in adding a blog (i.e., this section of my garden) to my website.
        -   She also helped me figure out how to [add some *pizzazz* to my web pages](https://samanthacsik.github.io/talks_workshops/2023-08-03-just-enough-css/).<br /><br />
-   Hilda
    -   Hilda is a graphic novel series and an animated television show created by [Luke Pearson](https://lukepearson.com/). It features gorgeous artwork which has been described as “Scandinavia by way of Miyazaki.” Take a look for yourself and I think you'll get it.

## Welcome to My Digital Garden

So, welcome to my digital garden! I'm not entirely sure what this place will become, but I don't envision it being an obnoxiously active spot vying for your clicks. I want this to be a place where I can share thoughts and ideas and, hopefully, be part of something bigger than myself.
