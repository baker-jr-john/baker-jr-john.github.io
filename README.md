Welcome to the repo for my digital garden, which has been planted and tended to with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You can use the code here as your garden plot.

This website is only possible with the work of people who came before me.

[Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com/)
- Her [guide to publishing a Quarto website with GitHub & Netlify](https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2023-11-19_publish-quarto-website/) was instrumental in my garden's development.

[Marvin Schmitt](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/)
- His [tutorial on creating a website with Quarto](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/) helped me get some details how I like them.

Silvia Canel√≥n
- [Her website](https://silviacanelon.com/) is gorgeous. Also, I went repo-diving through her code to figure out how to build my contact form.

Samantha Csik
- She helped me [add a blog to my site](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) and [make my garden look pretty](https://samanthacsik.github.io/talks_workshops/2023-08-03-just-enough-css/).

As [Silvia](https://silviacanelon.com/) would say, happy repo-diving!
