    "text": "Photo of Great Smoky Mountains National Park by Robert Thiemann on Unsplash\nOn Earth, there are an estimated 8.7 million living species. Each is linked to another, producing a complicated web of life. As a result, approximately 100 extinctions per million species occur each year; exotic and invasive species replace native species, disrupt natural systems, and decrease life’s variety. In addition, climate change, diseases, land conversion and fragmentation, and other stressors exacerbate biodiversity decline.\nTo explore this, I interpreted biodiversity data from the National Park Service, particularly around the various species observed in different national park locations. I attempted to view my work from the perspective of a biodiversity analyst for the National Park Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species and maintain biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, my main objectives were to understand species’ characteristics, conservation status, and those species’ relationship to the national parks. The following are some questions I posed:\nYou can find the data behind this project here.\nNote: The data was extracted on June 20, 2021.\nThe project can be viewed on GitHub."

    "text": "Preparation\nI utilized Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code for this project. In addition, I used the Python libraries pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn to aid in my data preparation, analysis, and visualization. Once I loaded the data into a data frame, I took a top-level look at its contents.\n\n\n\nThe first five lines of the dataset\n\n\nAs I first looked at the dataset, I wondered what the column title T&E meant. I had to refer to the source to learn that it was shorthand for “Threatened and Endangered.” To make things more straightforward, I changed the name of the column to Conservation Status.\n\n\n\nI changed the name of column T&E to Conservation Status.\n\n\nNext, I discovered that there are 35,716 rows and six columns in the data frame. As I explored the data more in-depth, I decided to find the number of distinct species present: 33,628 — WOW! Then, I wanted to see the number of classified living creatures represented in the data. There are 14, including animals and plants. After that, I tried to drill down to see the size of each Category. Insects have the largest share of species with 14,053 category entries, and reptiles are the smallest at 99.\nAnother column I wanted to explore is Conservation Status. It has five categories: SC, T, DM, E, and nan (not a number) values. (Here, nan denotes that these species don’t have conservation status.) Instead of leaving the values ambiguous, I decided to recheck the source for their proper terms and update them accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe updated Conservation Statuses\n\n\nNext, I wanted to view the breakdown of the categories in the Conservation Status column. There are 35,090 nan values, 597 species of concern, 13 endangered species, seven threatened, and 9 in recovery. The last tasks I performed before initiating my proper analysis were to check the number of parks and species observations in the dataset. There are only four parks, and there are 306,120 total sightings logged in the data set; that’s a lot of viewings!"

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nTo begin analyzing the data, I first cleaned and explored the Conservation Status column. It has a few possible values:\n\nSpecies of Concern: declining or appear to need conservation\nThreatened: vulnerable to endangerment soon\nEndangered: seriously at risk of extinction\nIn Recovery: currently neither in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\n\nDuring my initial exploration, I noticed many nan values, which were not desirable, so I converted them to be No Intervention. Next, I examined the different categories nested in the Conservation Status column, except those that do not require an intervention.\nFor those with the Endangered status, five are mammals, and four are birds. However, there are six birds and three mammals with the In Recovery status, which could mean the birds have bounced back more than the mammals.\n\n\n\nBirds may be recovering from endangerment more quickly than mammals.\n\n\nThat would be encouraging news since there are more birds in the Species of Concern category than any other variety.\n\n\n\nSince there are more birds in the Species of Concern category, it would be encouraging if they’re recovering from endangerment.\n\n\nNext, I wondered if certain species are more likely to be endangered. To answer this question, I first created a new column dubbed Is Protected, which included any species with a value other than No Intervention. Then, I grouped the column by Category and whether that category is protected or not. From the table below, it’s easy to see that birds, vascular plants, and mammals have a higher number of species protected.\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to see that birds, vascular plants, and mammals have a higher number of species protected.\n\n\nPlain-Jane numbers are not always the most useful statistic. Therefore, it’s also crucial to calculate the rate of protection that each category exhibits in the data. For example, approximately 19 percent of mammals and 39 percent of birds were under guard from the following table.\n\n\n\nApproximately 19 percent of mammals and 39 percent of birds were under guard.\n\n\n\nStatistical Significance\nI ran a couple of chi-squared tests to see if different species have statistically significant differences in conservation status rates. To start, I created a contingency table.\nFor the first test, I examined the difference between mammals and birds. The result indicated that there doesn’t seem to be a significant relationship between mammals and birds, so the next pair I tested the difference between was reptiles and mammals. According to the chi-squared test I ran, the difference between reptiles and mammals is statistically significant; mammals have a significantly higher rate of needed protection than reptiles.\n\n\nSpecies in Parks\nThe next set of analyses come from species sighting data. First, I looked at species’ Common Names to get an idea of the most prevalent animals in the dataset. Next, I split the data up into individual names. Then, I cleaned up duplicate words in each row to not count more than once per species. Next, I collapsed the words into one list for easier use. After that, to make the remainder of my analysis less complicated, I set all No Intervention values under the Observations column to 0 and the number type to float.\nAt this point, the data was cleaned up enough to count the occurrence of each word. As such, I determined that the phrase Bat occurred the most.\n\n\n\nBat occurs more than any other word counted.\n\n\nThere are several different scientific names for other bats in the data, so I wanted to figure out which rows of species referred to bats. To that end, I created a new column made up of boolean values to check if is_bat is True.\n\n\n\nDoes the Common Name refer to a species of bat?\n\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park observed the most bats, while Bryce Canyon National Park detected none.\n\n\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park observed the most bats, while Bryce Canyon National Park detected none.\n\n\nI wanted to see each park broken down by protected bat sightings vs. non-protected bat sightings. Except for Bryce Canyon National Park, every place has more sightings of protected bats — a good sign!\n\n\n\nEvery park has more sightings of protected bats than non-protected bats.\n\n\nAccording to the graph below, there are more sightings of protected bats than non-protected species. The national parks are doing a great job protecting their bat populations!\n\n\n\nThe national parks are doing a great job protecting their bat populations!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project makes several inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprise this data set. I was also able to answer the questions first posed in the beginning:\n\nThe vast majority of species were not part of the conservation effort (33,473 vs. 377).\nMammals and birds are the most protected species.\nWhile mammals and birds did not significantly differ in conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles did.\nBats were sighted the most, and they were most likely to be found at Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nThe National Park Service is staunchly involved in the preservation of a variety of environments. National parks are becoming vital biodiversity reserves in the wake of growing global threats. However, we need help to improve and expand biodiversity conservation efforts.\nAccording to the National Park Service, approximately 80 to 90% of living organisms in our national parks remain unknown. Biodiversity discovery activities often require only excited minds and willing hands, not expertise. Children and non-scientists alike can help with conservation efforts. In addition, parks can develop new, engaging relationships with diverse audiences to discover life on our lands.\nPublic involvement and education can yield an exponential increase in awareness of and motivation for stewardship of biodiversity. By working together, we can encourage a public who understands how biodiversity supports the fabric of our lives. We can begin to seed this understanding into our cultural DNA and how we engage with the living world through that knowledge."

Once I decided which countries to include in my query, I only needed to add the new_deaths.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 deaths by country as of July 11, 2021\n\n\nIt seems like every COVID-19 dashboard has a map. So why should mine be any different? With that in mind, I mapped the infection rate by country. First, I took the highest number from the total_cases and divided that by the population. Then, I listed the results per country and fed the results of the new table into Tableau.\n\n\n\nThe darker the color, the higher the infection rate\n\n\nFinally, I wanted to examine the infection rate over time, separated by country. To do so, I used the same query that I did for the map visualization but added date as a criterion.\n\n\n\nThe United States had the highest infection rate as of July 11, 2021."

As a result, scientists have significant pressure to find a cure to help those who contract the virus.\nDoctors have some medications they can use to treat the effects of COVID-19, but developing a drug that targets the virus itself is a complex and costly procedure. More than a year into the pandemic, only one antiviral treatment — remdesivir — is currently recommended for use in the US. Experts say remdesivir is not nearly effective enough, though.\nScientists are hopeful that new drugs designed to stop the virus’ deadly reproduction could reduce hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. In addition, the treatments offer hope and a contingency plan for unvaccinated individuals, particularly in low-income countries lagging far behind in the race to vaccinate."

    "title": "Projecting Elementary and Secondary School Enrollment",
    "section": "How to Project Enrollment",
    "text": "How to Project Enrollment\n\nProjection Techniques\nThere are several key methods that can be used for projecting student enrollment in elementary and secondary institutions such as ratio-based methods, regression-based methods, the dwelling unit multiplier method, and the extended demographic model. After some research and experimentation, I elected to use an exponential smoothing technique.\n\nExponential Smoothing\nSingle exponential smoothing is a forecasting method suited for data that is relatively stable over time, where future values are expected to be around the same central value as observed historically, without significant shifts up or down. In developing projections of elementary and secondary enrollments, for example, the rate at which students progress from one particular grade to the next (e.g., from grade 2 to grade 3) can be projected using single exponential smoothing. Thus, this percentage is assumed to be constant over the forecast period.\nGenerally, exponential smoothing places more weight on recent observations than on earlier ones. The weights for observations decrease exponentially as one moves further into the past. As a result, the older data have less influence on the projections. The rate at which the weights of older observations decrease is determined by the smoothing constant.\nWhen using single exponential smoothing for a time series, \\(P_t\\), a smoothed series, \\(P\\), is computed recursively by evaluating where \\[\\hat{P}_t = \\alpha~P_t + (1 - \\alpha) P_{t-1}\\]\\(0 &lt; \\alpha \\leq 1\\) is the smoothing constant.\nBy repeated substitution, we can rewrite the equation as \\[\nP_t = \\alpha \\sum_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 - \\alpha)^s P_{t-s}\\]where time, \\(s\\), goes from the first period in the time series, \\(0\\), to time period \\(t-1\\). The forecasts are constant for all years in the forecast period. The constant equals \\[\\hat{P}_{T+k} = \\hat{P}_t\\]where \\(t\\) is the last year of actual data and \\(k\\) is the \\(k^{th}\\) year in the forecast period where \\(k &gt; 0\\).\nThese equations illustrate that the projection is a weighted average based on exponentially decreasing weights. For higher smoothing constants, weights for earlier observations decrease more rapidly than for lower smoothing constants.\n\n\n\nApproach Overview\nI utilized the grade progression rate method to project grades 2 through 12. With this approach, a rate of progression from each grade (1 through 11) to the next grade (2 through 12) was projected using single exponential smoothing. For example, the rate of progression from grade 2 to grade 3 is the current year’s grade 3 enrollment expressed as a percentage of the previous year’s grade 2 enrollment. To calculate enrollment for each year in the forecast period, the progression rate for each grade was applied to the previous year’s enrollment in the previous grade.\nI also utilized the enrollment rate method to project prekindergarten, kindergarten, and first-grade enrollments as well as elementary and secondary ungraded enrollments. In this method, an enrollment rate for each grade (or ungraded level) was projected using single exponential smoothing. For example, the enrollment rate for grade 1 is the number of students enrolled in grade 1 divided by the number of 6-year-old children. To calculate enrollment for each year in the forecast period, the enrollment rate for each category was applied to the projected population in the appropriate age group.\n\nAssumptions Underlying This Approach\nThe grade progression rate method assumes that past trends affecting public and private elementary and secondary school enrollments will continue over the forecast period. This assumption implies that all factors influencing enrollments will display future patterns consistent with past patterns. This method implicitly includes the net effect of such factors as migration, dropouts, deaths, non-promotion, and transfers between public and private schools.\n\n\n\nProcedures and Equations\nThe notation and equations that follow describe the basic procedures used to project elementary and secondary enrollments in each of the three elementary and secondary enrollment projection models.\nLet:\n\\(j\\) = Subscript denoting grade\n\\(t\\) = Subscript denoting time\n\\(T\\) = Subscript of the first year in the forecast period\n\\(G_{j,t}\\) = Enrollment\n\\(R_{j,t}\\) = Progression rate.\nStep 1: Calculate historical grade progression rates for each of grade. The first step in projecting the enrollments using the grade progression method was to calculate, for each grade, a progression rate for each year of actual data used to produce the projections except for the first year. The progression rate for grade \\(j\\) in year \\(t\\) equals \\[R_{j,t} = \\frac{G_{j,t}}{G_{j-1,t-1}}\\]Step 2. Produce a projected progression rate for each grade. Projections for each grade’s progression rate were then produced for the forecast period using single exponential smoothing. A separate smoothing constant, chosen to minimize the sum of squared forecast errors, was used to calculate the projected progression rate for each grade. Single exponential smoothing produces a single forecast for all years in the forecast period. Therefore, for each grade \\(j\\), the projected progression rate, \\(\\hat{R}_j\\), is the same for each year in the forecast period.\nStep 3. Calculate enrollment projections for each grade. For the first year in the forecast period, \\(T\\), enrollment projections, \\(\\hat{G}_{j,T}\\), were produced using the projected progression rates and enrollments from the last year of actual data, \\(T–1\\). Specifcally, \\[\\hat{G}_{j,T} = \\hat{R}_j \\cdot \\hat{G}_{j-1, T-1}\\]This same procedure was then used to produce the projections for the following year, \\(T+1\\), except that enrollment projections for year \\(T\\) were used rather than actual numbers: \\[\\hat{G}_{j,T+1} = \\hat{R}_j \\cdot \\hat{G}_{j,T}\\] The enrollment projections for year \\(T\\) were those just produced using the grade progression method.\nThe same procedure was used for the remaining years in the projections period.\nStep 4. Calculate total elementary and secondary enrollments by summing the projections for each grade and the ungraded categories. To obtain projections of total enrollment, projections of enrollments for the individual grades, elementary ungraded, and secondary ungraded were summed."

    "text": "Process Overview\nThe process for forecasting student enrollment by grade level and total enrollment using historical data begins by viewing the enrollment data in Excel and making some minor adjustments before loading it into RStudio and preparing the data by renaming columns and calculating the total enrollment. A custom forecasting function is defined using the AAN (Additive error, Additive trend, No seasonality) exponential smoothing model from the forecast package. The forecasting function is then applied to each grade level and the total enrollment to generate predictions for the years 2022 to 2030. The forecasted values are stored in a list and subsequently used to create a forecast table. Finally, the code visualizes the forecasts by creating a grid of plots, with each plot representing the forecasted enrollment for a specific grade level or the total enrollment.\n\nData Used\nFor this exercise, I utilized data from the NCES’s Digest of Education Statistics’ Enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools, by level and grade: Selected years, fall 1980 through fall 2031. The dataset covers annual data from 1990 to 2021. it also includes data from 1980, 1985, and projections from 2022 through 2031 which I chose to ignore.\nI also utilized data from the United States Census Bureau’s Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Single Year of Age and Sex for the United States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2020. This dataset provides detailed population estimates for the United States by single year of age, sex, and year from 2010 to 2020.\n\n\nData Loading and Preparation\nTo use the data, I initially had to modify the spreadsheet in Excel. First, I un-merged cells A3:A4 and B3:B4. Then, I deleted row 5. After the data was in a usable state, I moved the project to RStudio.\nOnce in RStudio, I loaded the packages I used: - readxl for reading Excel files and - forecast for time series forecasting. I used the read_excel() function from the readxl package to load data from the Excel file. Then, I used the colnames() function to rename the columns of the loaded data frame (enrollment) with more descriptive names. I also created a new column named “enrollment_total” to the enrollment data frame, which was calculated as the row-wise sum of all columns except the first one (assuming the first column is not numeric). The na.rm = TRUE argument was used to handle any missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n# Load data\nenrollment &lt;- read_excel(\n  \"tabn203.10.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"Digest 2022 Table 203.10\",\n  range = \"A4:U38\",\n  col_types = c(\n    \"text\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\"\n  )\n)\n\n# Rename columns\ncolnames(enrollment) &lt;-\n  c(\n    \"Year\",\n    \"Prekindergarten\",\n    \"Kindergarten\",\n    \"First_grade\",\n    \"Second_grade\",\n    \"Third_grade\",\n    \"Fourth_grade\",\n    \"Fifth_grade\",\n    \"Sixth_grade\",\n    \"Seventh_grade\",\n    \"Eighth_grade\",\n    \"Elementary_ungraded\",\n    \"Ninth_grade\",\n    \"Tenth_grade\",\n    \"Eleventh_grade\",\n    \"Twelfth_grade\",\n    \"Secondary_ungraded\"\n  )\n\n# Calculate prekindergarten through eighth-grade enrollment\nenrollment$pk_8_enrollment &lt;-\n  rowSums(enrollment[, c(\n    \"Prekindergarten\",\n    \"Kindergarten\",\n    \"First_grade\",\n    \"Second_grade\",\n    \"Third_grade\",\n    \"Fourth_grade\",\n    \"Fifth_grade\",\n    \"Sixth_grade\",\n    \"Seventh_grade\",\n    \"Eighth_grade\",\n    \"Elementary_ungraded\"\n  )], na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Calculate grades nine through twelve enrollment\nenrollment$grades_9_12_enrollment &lt;-\n  rowSums(enrollment[, c(\n    \"Ninth_grade\",\n    \"Tenth_grade\",\n    \"Eleventh_grade\",\n    \"Twelfth_grade\",\n    \"Secondary_ungraded\"\n  )], na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Calculate total enrollment\nenrollment$enrollment_total &lt;-\n  rowSums(enrollment[, c(\"pk_8_enrollment\", \"grades_9_12_enrollment\")], na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasting Functions\nI defined a custom function named forecast_grade_level() to forecast enrollment for a specific grade level. This function takes a grade level as input and performs the following steps: 1. Prepares the time series data using the ts() function, specifying the start and end years and the frequency (1 for annual data). 2. Specifies and fits an AAN (Additive error, Additive trend, No seasonality) exponential smoothing model using the ets() function from the forecast package. 3. Makes predictions for the years 2022 to 2030 using the forecast() function. 4. Returns a list containing the forecasted means and the complete forecast object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Function to forecast enrollment for a specific grade level or enrollment category\nforecast_enrollment &lt;- function(enrollment_category) {\n  # Prepare the time series data\n  enrollment_ts &lt;-\n    ts(enrollment[[enrollment_category]],\n       start = 1990,\n       end = 2021,\n       frequency = 1)\n  \n  # Specify and fit the AAN exponential smoothing model\n  enrollment_model &lt;- ets(enrollment_ts, model = \"AAN\")\n  \n  # Make predictions for 2022 to 2030\n  enrollment_forecast &lt;- forecast(enrollment_model, h = 9)\n  \n  # Return the forecast\n  return(list(mean = enrollment_forecast$mean, forecast = enrollment_forecast))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasting Enrollment\nI created a vector named grade_levels, containing the names of all grade levels and the enrollment total. I used the lapply() function to apply the forecast_grade_level() function to each grade level in the grade_levels vector.

    "text": "How to Project Enrollment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a detailed methodology for projecting student enrollment using various statistical techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection Techniques\nThere are several key methods that can be used for projecting student enrollment in elementary and secondary institutions such as ratio-based methods, regression-based methods, the dwelling unit multiplier method, and the extended demographic model. After some research and experimentation, I elected to use an exponential smoothing technique.\n\nExponential Smoothing\nSingle exponential smoothing is a forecasting method suited for data that is relatively stable over time, where future values are expected to be around the same central value as observed historically, without significant shifts up or down. In developing projections of elementary and secondary enrollments, for example, the rate at which students progress from one particular grade to the next (e.g., from grade 2 to grade 3) can be projected using single exponential smoothing. Thus, this percentage is assumed to be constant over the forecast period.\nGenerally, exponential smoothing places more weight on recent observations than on earlier ones. The weights for observations decrease exponentially as one moves further into the past. As a result, the older data have less influence on the projections. The rate at which the weights of older observations decrease is determined by the smoothing constant.\nWhen using single exponential smoothing for a time series, \\(P_t\\), a smoothed series, \\(P\\), is computed recursively by evaluating where \\[\\hat{P}_t = \\alpha~P_t + (1 - \\alpha) P_{t-1}\\]\\(0 &lt; \\alpha \\leq 1\\) is the smoothing constant.\nBy repeated substitution, we can rewrite the equation as \\[\nP_t = \\alpha \\sum_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 - \\alpha)^s P_{t-s}\\]where time, \\(s\\), goes from the first period in the time series, \\(0\\), to time period \\(t-1\\). The forecasts are constant for all years in the forecast period. The constant equals \\[\\hat{P}_{T+k} = \\hat{P}_t\\]where \\(t\\) is the last year of actual data and \\(k\\) is the \\(k^{th}\\) year in the forecast period where \\(k &gt; 0\\).\nThese equations illustrate that the projection is a weighted average based on exponentially decreasing weights. For higher smoothing constants, weights for earlier observations decrease more rapidly than for lower smoothing constants.\n\n\n\nApproach Overview\nI utilized the grade progression rate method to project grades 2 through 12. With this approach, a rate of progression from each grade (1 through 11) to the next grade (2 through 12) was projected using single exponential smoothing. For example, the rate of progression from grade 2 to grade 3 is the current year’s grade 3 enrollment expressed as a percentage of the previous year’s grade 2 enrollment. To calculate enrollment for each year in the forecast period, the progression rate for each grade was applied to the previous year’s enrollment in the previous grade.\nI also utilized the enrollment rate method to project prekindergarten, kindergarten, and first-grade enrollments as well as elementary and secondary ungraded enrollments. In this method, an enrollment rate for each grade (or ungraded level) was projected using single exponential smoothing. For example, the enrollment rate for grade 1 is the number of students enrolled in grade 1 divided by the number of 6-year-old children. To calculate enrollment for each year in the forecast period, the enrollment rate for each category was applied to the projected population in the appropriate age group.\n\nAssumptions Underlying This Approach\nThe grade progression rate method assumes that past trends affecting public and private elementary and secondary school enrollments will continue over the forecast period. This assumption implies that all factors influencing enrollments will display future patterns consistent with past patterns. This method implicitly includes the net effect of such factors as migration, dropouts, deaths, non-promotion, and transfers between public and private schools.\n\n\nLimitations of Projections\nProjections are complicated by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Projections are based on the assumption that historical patterns will continue into the future. This presents challenges both for (1) using prepandemic historical data to predict unprecedented pandemic-era behaviors and (2) using pandemic-era data to predict post-pandemic behaviors. This exercise includes both scenarios.\nEven without a pandemic, projections of a time series usually differ from the final reported data due to errors from many sources, such as the properties of the projection methodologies, which depend on the validity of many assumptions. These projections should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\nProcedures and Equations\nThe notation and equations that follow describe the basic procedures used to project elementary and secondary enrollments in each of the three elementary and secondary enrollment projection models.\nLet:\n\\(i\\) = Subscript denoting age\n\\(j\\) = Subscript denoting grade\n\\(t\\) = Subscript denoting time\n\\(T\\) = Subscript of the first year in the forecast period\n\\(N_t\\) = Enrollment at the prekindergarten (nursery) level\n\\(K_t\\) = Enrollment at the kindergarten level\n\\(G_{j,t}\\) = Enrollment\n\\(E_t\\) = Enrollment in elementary ungraded programs\n\\(S_t\\) = Enrollment in secondary ungraded programs\n\\(P_{i,t}\\) = Population\n\\(R_{j,t}\\) = Progression rate\n\\(RN_t\\) = Enrollment rate for prekindergarten (nursery school)\n\\(RK_t\\) = Enrollment rate for kindergarten\n\\(RG_{1,t}\\) = Enrollment rate for grade 1\n\\(RE_t\\) = Enrollment rate for elementary ungraded programs\n\\(RS_t\\) = Enrollment rate for secondary ungraded programs.\nStep 1. Calculate historical grade progression rates for each of grade. The first step in projecting the enrollments using the grade progression method was to calculate, for each grade, a progression rate for each year of actual data used to produce the projections except for the first year. The progression rate for grade \\(j\\) in year \\(t\\) equals \\[R_{j,t} = \\frac{G_{j,t}}{G_{j-1,t-1}}\\]Step 2. Produce a projected progression rate for each of grades 2 through 12. Projections for each grade’s progression rate were then produced for the forecast period using single exponential smoothing. A separate smoothing constant, chosen to minimize the sum of squared forecast errors, was used to calculate the projected progression rate for each grade. Single exponential smoothing produces a single forecast for all years in the forecast period. Therefore, for each grade \\(j\\), the projected progression rate, \\(\\hat{R}_j\\), is the same for each year in the forecast period.\nStep 3. Calculate enrollment projections for each of grades 2 through 12. For the first year in the forecast period, \\(T\\), enrollment projections, \\(\\hat{G}_{j,T}\\), for grades 2 though 12 were produced using the projected progression rates and enrollments of grades 1 though 11 from the last year of actual data, \\(T–1\\). Specifically, \\[\\hat{G}_{j,T} = \\hat{R}_j \\cdot \\hat{G}_{j-1, T-1}\\]This same procedure was then used to produce the projections for the following year, \\(T+1\\), except that enrollment projections for year \\(T\\) were used rather than actual numbers: \\[\\hat{G}_{j,T+1} = \\hat{R}_j \\cdot \\hat{G}_{j,T}\\] The enrollment projections for grades 2 through 11 for year \\(T\\) were those just produced using the grade progression method. The projection for grade 1 for year \\(T\\) was produced using the enrollment rate method as outlined in steps 4, 5, and 6 below.\nThe same procedure was used for the remaining years in the projections period.\nStep 4. Calculate historical enrollment rates for prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1, elementary ungraded, and secondary ungraded. The first step in projecting prekindergarten, kindergarten, first-grade, elementary ungraded, and secondary ungraded enrollments using the enrollment rate method was to calculate enrollment rates for each enrollment category for the last year of actual data, \\(T–1\\), where: \\[RN_t = \\frac{N_t}{P_{5,t}}\\] \\[RK_t = \\frac{K_t}{P_{5,t}}\\] \\[RG_{1,t} = \\frac{G_{1,t}} {P_{6,t}}\\] \\[RE_t = \\frac{E_t}{\\sum_{i=5}^{13}P_{i,t}}\\] \\[RS_t = \\frac{S_t}{\\sum_{i=14}^{17}P_{i,t}}\\] Step 5. Produce a projected enrollment rate for prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1, elementary ungraded, and secondary ungraded. Projections for each category’s enrollment rate were produced for the forecast period using single exponential smoothing. A separate smoothing constant, chosen to minimize the sum of squared forecast errors, was used to calculate the projected enrollment rate for each of these grades (or ungraded levels), specifically for prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1, elementary ungraded, and secondary ungraded. Single exponential smoothing produces a single forecast for all years in the forecast period. These enrollment rates were then used as the projected enrollment rates for each year in the forecast period (\\(\\hat{RN}\\), \\(\\hat{RK}\\), \\(\\hat{RG}_1\\), \\(\\hat{RE}\\), and \\(\\hat{RS}\\)).\nStep 6. Calculate enrollment projections for prekindergarten through grad 1 and the ungraded categories. For each year in the forecast period, the enrollment rates were then multiplied by the appropriate population projections (\\(\\hat{P_{i,t}}\\)) to calculate enrollment projections for prekindergarten (\\(\\hat{N_t}\\)), kindergarten (\\(\\hat{K_t}\\)), first grade (\\(\\hat{G}_{1,t}\\)), elementary ungraded (\\(\\hat{E}_t\\)), and secondary ungraded (\\(\\hat{S}_t\\)).\\[\\hat{N}_t = \\hat{RN} \\cdot \\hat{P}_{5,t}\\] \\[\\hat{K}_t = \\hat{RK} \\cdot \\hat{P}_{5,t}\\] \\[\\hat{G}_{1,t} = \\hat{RG}_1 \\cdot \\hat{P}_{6,t}\\] \\[\\hat{E}_t = \\hat{RE} \\cdot \\sum_{i=5}^{13}\\hat{P}_{i,t}\\] \\[\\hat{S}_t = \\hat{RS} \\cdot \\sum_{i=14}^{17}\\hat{P}_{i,t}\\] Step 7. Calculate total elementary and secondary enrollments by summing the projections for each grade and the ungraded categories. To obtain projections of total enrollment, projections of enrollments for the individual grades, elementary ungraded, and secondary ungraded were summed.\nBy following these steps and utilizing the provided methodologies, I can project national public school enrollments from 2021 through 2030 with a reasonable degree of accuracy."

    "text": "Process Overview\nThe process for forecasting student enrollment by grade level and total enrollment using historical data begins by viewing the enrollment data in Excel and making some minor adjustments before loading it into RStudio. It calculates enrollment rates for various grades based on historical and projected population data, then applies exponential smoothing to the historical data to create a trend. Using historical progression rates, future enrollments from 2021 to 2030 are projected. It combines actual and projected data, filters for the years 2010 to 2030, and creates aggregate columns for PK-Grade 8, Grades 9-12, and Total enrollments. The data is reshaped for plotting, and a line plot is generated. The plot visualizes enrollment trends, distinguishing between actual and projected data.\n\nData Used\nFor this exercise, I utilized data from the NCES’s Digest of Education Statistics’ Enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools, by level and grade: Selected years, fall 1980 through fall 2030. The dataset covers annual data from 1990 to 2020. it also includes data from 1980, 1985, and projections from 2021 through 2030 which I chose to ignore.\nI also utilized Table B-1 and Table B-2 from the NCES’s Projections of Education Statistics to 2030. Table B-1 contains data on the population of prekindergarten- and kindergarten-age children from 2010 through 2030. Table B-2 contains data on the school-age population from 2010 through 2030, with the values. Both datasets include actual values for the years 2010 through 2020 and projected values from 2021 onward (Irwin et al. 2024).\n\n\nData Loading and Preparation\nTo use the data, I initially had to modify the spreadsheet in Excel. First, I un-merged cells A3:A4, B3:B4, and D4:E4. Then, I moved “Year” and “All” from cells A3 and B3 to cells A4 and B4. I also had to modify the ramining cells in row 4:\n\nCell C4 from “Total” to “Total PK-8”\nCell D4 from “Prekinder- garten” to “Prekindergarten”\nCell F4 from ” Kinder-garten” to “Kindergarten”\nCell G4 from ” 1st grade” to “1st grade”\nCell H4 from ” 2nd grade” to “2nd grade”\nCell I4 from ” 3rd grade” to “3rd grade”\nCell J4 from ” 4th grade” to “4th grade”\nCell K4 from ” 5th grade” to “5th grade”\nCell L4 from ” 6th grade” to “6th grade”\nCell M4 from ” 7th grade” to “7th grade”\nCell N4 from ” 8th grade” to “8th grade”\nCell O4 from “Un- graded\\1” to “Ungraded PK-8”\nCell P4 from “Total” to “Total 9-12”\nCell Q4 from ” 9th grade” to “9th grade”\nCell R4 from ” 10th grade” to “10th grade”\nCell S4 from ” 11th grade” to “11th grade”\nCell T4 from ” 12th grade” to “12th grade”\nCell U4 from “Un- graded\\1,2” to “Ungraded 9-12”\n\nAdditionally, I had to delete “\\4” from cell A37. Finally, I deleted row 5. I converted the spreadsheet from the .xls file format to .xlsx by saving it as .xlsx. After the data was in a usable state, I moved the project to RStudio.\nOnce in RStudio, the script begins by loading the readxl library for reading Excel files. The dplyr library is also loaded to facilitate data manipulation. The enrollment data is then read from an Excel file, specifically from a range of cells (A4:U37), with certain columns skipped, and the remaining columns are renamed for convenience. Similarly, population data, which includes projected school-age population by selected age groups from 2010 through 2030, is read from another Excel file. To calculate enrollment rates, the enrollment data is joined with the population data on the Year column. This allows the script to compute the enrollment rates for Prekindergarten, Kindergarten, 1st grade, and ungraded enrollments based on the respective age groups in the population data. The mean enrollment rates are then computed, which will be used for forecasting future enrollments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Load enrollment data\nenrollment &lt;- read_excel(\n  \"data/tabn203.10.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"Digest 2021 Table 203.10\",\n  range = \"A4:U37\",\n  col_types = c(\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"skip\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\"\n  )\n)\n\n# Rename the columns for convenience\ncolnames(enrollment) &lt;- c(\"Year\", \"Prekindergarten\", \"Kindergarten\", \"1st_grade\", \"2nd_grade\", \"3rd_grade\",\n                          \"4th_grade\", \"5th_grade\", \"6th_grade\", \"7th_grade\", \"8th_grade\", \"9th_grade\", \n                          \"10th_grade\", \"11th_grade\", \"12th_grade\", \"Ungraded_PK_8\", \"Ungraded_9_12\")\n\n# Load population data\npopulation &lt;- read_excel(\n  \"data/actual_and_projected_school-age_populations_by_selected_ages-_2010_through_2030.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"Sheet1\",\n  col_types = c(\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\",\n    \"numeric\"\n  )\n)\n\n# Calculate enrollment rates for Prekindergarten, Kindergarten, 1st grade, and Ungraded enrollments\nenrollment_rates &lt;- enrollment %&gt;%\n  inner_join(population, by = \"Year\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Prekindergarten_rate = Prekindergarten / `3- to 5-year-olds`,\n    Kindergarten_rate = Kindergarten / `5-year-olds`,\n    first_grade_rate = `1st_grade` / `6-year-olds`,\n    Ungraded_PK_8_rate = Ungraded_PK_8 / `5- to 13-year-olds`,\n    Ungraded_9_12_rate = Ungraded_9_12 / `14- to 17-year-olds`\n  ) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Prekindergarten_rate = mean(Prekindergarten_rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Kindergarten_rate = mean(Kindergarten_rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    first_grade_rate = mean(first_grade_rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Ungraded_PK_8_rate = mean(Ungraded_PK_8_rate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Ungraded_9_12_rate = mean(Ungraded_9_12_rate, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasting Functions\nIn this section, the script defines an exponential smoothing function to create smoothed trends from historical enrollment data. This function, exponential_smoothing, takes a time series and a smoothing parameter, alpha, as inputs. It initializes the result with the first value of the series and then iteratively applies the exponential smoothing formula: each subsequent value is a weighted average of the current actual value and the previous smoothed value. This technique helps reduce variability in the data, making trends more apparent and stable for forecasting purposes. The smoothed values produced by this function are crucial for generating accurate and reliable projections of future enrollments based on historical trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Define exponential smoothing function to return full series\nexponential_smoothing &lt;- function(series, alpha = 0.3) {\n  result &lt;- numeric(length(series))\n  result[1] &lt;- series[1]  # Initialize with the first value\n  for (i in 2:length(series)) {\n    result[i] &lt;- alpha * series[i] + (1 - alpha) * result[i - 1]\n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasting Enrollment\nHere, the script utilizes the previously defined exponential smoothing function and calculated enrollment rates to project future enrollments from 2021 to 2030. Initially, the historical enrollment data is smoothed to reduce variability and create stable trends. A new dataframe is then created to hold projected enrollment values for each grade level. The script calculates progression rates, which represent the average proportion of students progressing from one grade to the next based on historical data. Using these rates, the script populates the projections dataframe, starting with the last smoothed value from the historical data and applying the progression rates for subsequent years. Specific projections for Prekindergarten, Kindergarten, 1st grade, and ungraded enrollments are computed using the enrollment rates and projected population data. This detailed approach ensures that the projections are grounded in historical trends and population forecasts, providing a comprehensive view of future enrollment patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Apply exponential smoothing to historical data\nsmoothed_values &lt;- enrollment %&gt;%\n  select(-Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~exponential_smoothing(.x, alpha = 0.3)))\n\n# Initialize projections dataframe\nyears &lt;- 2021:2030\nprojections &lt;- data.frame(Year = years)\n\n# Calculate progression rates for other grades\nprogression_rates &lt;- enrollment %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(starts_with(\"grade\"), list(rate = ~mean(.x / lag(.x, 1), na.rm = TRUE)), .names = \"{col}_rate\"))\n\n# Populate the projections dataframe for grades with historical progression rates\nfor (grade in names(smoothed_values)) {\n  last_value &lt;- tail(smoothed_values[[grade]], 1)\n  projections[[grade]] &lt;- c(last_value, rep(NA, length(years) - 1))\n  \n  for (year_index in 2:length(years)) {\n    year &lt;- years[year_index]\n    previous_year &lt;- years[year_index - 1]\n    rate &lt;- progression_rates[[paste0(grade, \"_rate\")]]\n    if (!is.null(rate) && !is.na(rate)) {\n      projections[year_index, grade] &lt;- projections[year_index - 1, grade] * rate\n    } else {\n      projections[year_index, grade] &lt;- projections[year_index - 1, grade]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n# Project Prekindergarten, Kindergarten, 1st grade, and Ungraded enrollments using enrollment rates\nfor (year in years) {\n  projections[projections$Year == year, \"Prekindergarten\"] &lt;- population[population$Year == year, \"3- to 5-year-olds\"] * enrollment_rates$Prekindergarten_rate\n  projections[projections$Year == year, \"Kindergarten\"] &lt;- population[population$Year == year, \"5-year-olds\"] * enrollment_rates$Kindergarten_rate\n  projections[projections$Year == year, \"1st_grade\"] &lt;- population[population$Year == year, \"6-year-olds\"] * enrollment_rates$first_grade_rate\n  projections[projections$Year == year, \"Ungraded_PK_8\"] &lt;- population[population$Year == year, \"5- to 13-year-olds\"] * enrollment_rates$Ungraded_PK_8_rate\n  projections[projections$Year == year, \"Ungraded_9_12\"] &lt;- population[population$Year == year, \"14- to 17-year-olds\"] * enrollment_rates$Ungraded_9_12_rate\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecast Table\nIn this section of code, the gt library is loaded to facilitate the creation of well-formatted tables. The code then constructs a data frame, forecast_table_df, which contains projected enrollment data for various grade levels. This data frame is derived from the filtered_data object, specifically filtering for projected enrollment data (Type == \"Projected\"). It selects the relevant columns: Year, Prekindergarten, Kindergarten, and grades from 1st_grade to 12th_grade. These grade columns are then renamed to more readable names, such as “First Grade” for 1st_grade, “Second Grade” for 2nd_grade, and so on. The renamed data frame is then passed to the gt function to create a table object, forecast_table. A header is added to this table with the title “Enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools, by grade (in thousands)”. Finally, the table is displayed. This process results in a well-organized and readable table that presents the projected enrollment figures for each grade level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load `gt` library\nlibrary(gt)\n\n# Create a data frame with the forecasts for grade levels\nforecast_table_df &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Type == \"Projected\") %&gt;%\n  select(\n    Year,\n    Prekindergarten,\n    Kindergarten,\n    `1st_grade`,\n    `2nd_grade`,\n    `3rd_grade`,\n    `4th_grade`,\n    `5th_grade`,\n    `6th_grade`,\n    `7th_grade`,\n    `8th_grade`,\n    `9th_grade`,\n    `10th_grade`,\n    `11th_grade`,\n    `12th_grade`\n  ) %&gt;%\n  rename(\n    \"First Grade\" = `1st_grade`,\n    \"Second Grade\" = `2nd_grade`,\n    \"Third Grade\" = `3rd_grade`,\n    \"Fourth Grade\" = `4th_grade`,\n    \"Fifth Grade\" = `5th_grade`,\n    \"Sixth Grade\" = `6th_grade`,\n    \"Seventh Grade\" = `7th_grade`,\n    \"Eighth Grade\" = `8th_grade`,\n    \"Ninth Grade\" = `9th_grade`,\n    \"Tenth Grade\" = `10th_grade`,\n    \"Eleventh Grade\" = `11th_grade`,\n    \"Twelfth Grade\" = `12th_grade`\n  )\n\n# Create the gt table\nforecast_table &lt;- gt(forecast_table_df)\n\n# Add a table header\nforecast_table &lt;- forecast_table %&gt;%\n  tab_header(title = \"Enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools, by grade (in thousands)\")\n\n# Display the table\nforecast_table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in public elementary schools, by grade (Prekindergarten to Fifth Grade, in thousands)\n\n\nYear\nPrekindergarten\nKindergarten\nFirst Grade\nSecond Grade\nThird Grade\nFourth Grade\nFifth Grade\n\n\n\n\n2021\n1355.073\n3683.308\n3739.755\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2022\n1330.427\n3603.117\n3711.327\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2023\n1314.224\n3552.087\n3633.377\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2024\n1268.812\n3492.855\n3582.939\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2025\n1229.903\n3476.452\n3523.330\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2026\n1212.217\n3191.228\n3507.740\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2027\n1233.668\n3181.204\n3220.701\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2028\n1263.791\n3337.941\n3211.531\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2029\n1278.853\n3362.545\n3368.348\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n2030\n1294.485\n3421.777\n3394.025\n3647.011\n3688.938\n3716.536\n3758.302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in public secondary schools, by grade (Sixth Grade to Twelfth Grade, in thousands)\n\n\nYear\nSixth Grade\nSeventh Grade\nEighth Grade\nNinth Grade\nTenth Grade\nEleventh Grade\nTwelfth Grade\n\n\n\n\n2021\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2022\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2023\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2024\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2025\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2026\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2027\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2028\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2029\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n2030\n3801.9\n3831.481\n3818.897\n90.61842\n4016.736\n3857.706\n3657.681\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Combination and Visualization\nThe code performs a series of data manipulation and visualization tasks to create a line plot that displays the projected enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools from 2010 to 2030. First, it combines actual and projected enrollment data into a single dataset, marking each entry as either “Actual” or “Projected.” It then filters this combined dataset to include only the years 2010 to 2030 and arranges the data in chronological order. New columns are created to represent the total enrollment for PK-Grade 8, Grades 9-12, and the overall Total enrollment. The data is then reshaped into a long format suitable for plotting with ggplot2.\nIn the visualization step, a line plot is created using ggplot2, with different colors representing the categories Total, PK-Grade 8, and Grades 9-12. The x-axis shows the years, and the y-axis shows the enrollment in thousands. Vertical dashed lines and annotations indicate the separation between actual and projected data. The plot is customized with specific colors, labels, and a minimal theme. Finally, the plot is printed, displaying the enrollment trends over time with clear distinctions between different grade levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the code I used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load `ggplot2` library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Combine actual and projected data\ncombined_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  enrollment %&gt;% mutate(Type = \"Actual\"),\n  projections %&gt;% mutate(Type = \"Projected\")\n)\n\n# Filter data for the years 2010 to 2030\nfiltered_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;% filter(Year &gt;= 2010 & Year &lt;= 2030)\n\n# Arrange the data in the required format and sort by Year\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;% arrange(Year)\n\n# Create new columns for PK-Grade 8, Grades 9-12, and Total\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PK_Grade_8 = Prekindergarten + Kindergarten + `1st_grade` + `2nd_grade` + `3rd_grade` + `4th_grade` + `5th_grade` + `6th_grade` + `7th_grade` + `8th_grade` + Ungraded_PK_8,\n    Grades_9_12 = `9th_grade` + `10th_grade` + `11th_grade` + `12th_grade` + Ungraded_9_12,\n    Total = PK_Grade_8 + Grades_9_12\n  )\n\n# Create a long format dataframe for plotting\nplot_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  select(Year, PK_Grade_8, Grades_9_12, Total) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(PK_Grade_8, Grades_9_12, Total), names_to = \"Category\", values_to = \"Enrollment\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels = c(\"Total\", \"PK_Grade_8\", \"Grades_9_12\")))\n\n# Create the line plot\nenrollment_plot &lt;- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Year, y = Enrollment / 1000, color = Category)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2021, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2015, y = max(plot_data$Enrollment) / 1000 * 0.9, label = \"Actual\", size = 4) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2025, y = max(plot_data$Enrollment) / 1000 * 0.9, label = \"Projected\", size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total\" = \"#009E73\", \"PK_Grade_8\" = \"#E69F00\", \"Grades_9_12\" = \"#56B4E9\"),\n    labels = c(\"Total\", \"PK-Grade 8\", \"Grades 9-12\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(title = \"Enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools, by level\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Enrollment (in thousands)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(enrollment_plot)"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis comprehensive methodology for projecting student enrollment in elementary and secondary schools provides a robust framework for educational planners and policymakers. By utilizing exponential smoothing techniques, grade progression rates, and enrollment rate methods, this approach offers a nuanced view of future enrollment trends from 2021 through 2030.\nThe process outlined here, from data preparation to visualization, allows for a detailed analysis of enrollment patterns across different grade levels and age groups. It takes into account historical trends, demographic shifts, and the potential long-term impacts of unprecedented events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile these projections offer valuable insights for resource allocation, budgeting, and long-term planning in education, it’s crucial to interpret them with caution. The inherent limitations of forecasting, particularly in the face of unforeseen circumstances, underscore the need for regular updates and adaptations to these projections.\nBy combining rigorous statistical methods with clear data visualization, this approach not only aids in decision-making processes but also facilitates effective communication of enrollment trends to stakeholders. As the education landscape continues to evolve, such data-driven projections will play an increasingly vital role in shaping responsive and resilient educational systems.\n\nReferences\n\n\nIrwin et al. 2024. “Projections of Education Statistics to 2030.” NCES 2024-034.
