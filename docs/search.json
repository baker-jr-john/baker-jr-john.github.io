    "text": "Photo of Great Smoky Mountains National Park by Robert Thiemann on Unsplash\nOn Earth, there are an estimated 8.7 million living species. Each is linked to another, producing a complicated web of life. As a result, approximately 100 extinctions per million species occur each year; exotic and invasive species replace native species, disrupt natural systems, and decrease life’s variety. In addition, climate change, diseases, land conversion and fragmentation, and other stressors exacerbate biodiversity decline.\nTo explore this, I interpreted biodiversity data from the National Park Service, particularly around the various species observed in different national park locations. I attempted to view my work from the perspective of a biodiversity analyst for the National Park Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species and maintain biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, my main objectives were to understand species’ characteristics, conservation status, and those species’ relationship to the national parks. The following are some questions I posed:\nYou can find the data behind this project here.\nNote: The data was extracted on June 20, 2021.\nThe project can be viewed on GitHub."

    "text": "Preparation\nI utilized Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code for this project. In addition, I used the Python libraries pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn to aid in my data preparation, analysis, and visualization. Once I loaded the data into a data frame, I took a top-level look at its contents.\n\n\n\nThe first five lines of the dataset\n\n\nAs I first looked at the dataset, I wondered what the column title T&E meant. I had to refer to the source to learn that it was shorthand for “Threatened and Endangered.” To make things more straightforward, I changed the name of the column to Conservation Status.\n\n\n\nI changed the name of column T&E to Conservation Status.\n\n\nNext, I discovered that there are 35,716 rows and six columns in the data frame. As I explored the data more in-depth, I decided to find the number of distinct species present: 33,628 — WOW! Then, I wanted to see the number of classified living creatures represented in the data. There are 14, including animals and plants. After that, I tried to drill down to see the size of each Category. Insects have the largest share of species with 14,053 category entries, and reptiles are the smallest at 99.\nAnother column I wanted to explore is Conservation Status. It has five categories: SC, T, DM, E, and nan (not a number) values. (Here, nan denotes that these species don’t have conservation status.) Instead of leaving the values ambiguous, I decided to recheck the source for their proper terms and update them accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe updated Conservation Statuses\n\n\nNext, I wanted to view the breakdown of the categories in the Conservation Status column. There are 35,090 nan values, 597 species of concern, 13 endangered species, seven threatened, and 9 in recovery. The last tasks I performed before initiating my proper analysis were to check the number of parks and species observations in the dataset. There are only four parks, and there are 306,120 total sightings logged in the data set; that’s a lot of viewings!"

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nTo begin analyzing the data, I first cleaned and explored the Conservation Status column. It has a few possible values:\n\nSpecies of Concern: declining or appear to need conservation\nThreatened: vulnerable to endangerment soon\nEndangered: seriously at risk of extinction\nIn Recovery: currently neither in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\n\nDuring my initial exploration, I noticed many nan values, which were not desirable, so I converted them to be No Intervention. Next, I examined the different categories nested in the Conservation Status column, except those that do not require an intervention.\nFor those with the Endangered status, five are mammals, and four are birds. However, there are six birds and three mammals with the In Recovery status, which could mean the birds have bounced back more than the mammals.\n\n\n\nBirds may be recovering from endangerment more quickly than mammals.\n\n\nThat would be encouraging news since there are more birds in the Species of Concern category than any other variety.\n\n\n\nSince there are more birds in the Species of Concern category, it would be encouraging if they’re recovering from endangerment.\n\n\nNext, I wondered if certain species are more likely to be endangered. To answer this question, I first created a new column dubbed Is Protected, which included any species with a value other than No Intervention. Then, I grouped the column by Category and whether that category is protected or not. From the table below, it’s easy to see that birds, vascular plants, and mammals have a higher number of species protected.\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to see that birds, vascular plants, and mammals have a higher number of species protected.\n\n\nPlain-Jane numbers are not always the most useful statistic. Therefore, it’s also crucial to calculate the rate of protection that each category exhibits in the data. For example, approximately 19 percent of mammals and 39 percent of birds were under guard from the following table.\n\n\n\nApproximately 19 percent of mammals and 39 percent of birds were under guard.\n\n\n\nStatistical Significance\nI ran a couple of chi-squared tests to see if different species have statistically significant differences in conservation status rates. To start, I created a contingency table.\nFor the first test, I examined the difference between mammals and birds. The result indicated that there doesn’t seem to be a significant relationship between mammals and birds, so the next pair I tested the difference between was reptiles and mammals. According to the chi-squared test I ran, the difference between reptiles and mammals is statistically significant; mammals have a significantly higher rate of needed protection than reptiles.\n\n\nSpecies in Parks\nThe next set of analyses come from species sighting data. First, I looked at species’ Common Names to get an idea of the most prevalent animals in the dataset. Next, I split the data up into individual names. Then, I cleaned up duplicate words in each row to not count more than once per species. Next, I collapsed the words into one list for easier use. After that, to make the remainder of my analysis less complicated, I set all No Intervention values under the Observations column to 0 and the number type to float.\nAt this point, the data was cleaned up enough to count the occurrence of each word. As such, I determined that the phrase Bat occurred the most.\n\n\n\nBat occurs more than any other word counted.\n\n\nThere are several different scientific names for other bats in the data, so I wanted to figure out which rows of species referred to bats. To that end, I created a new column made up of boolean values to check if is_bat is True.\n\n\n\nDoes the Common Name refer to a species of bat?\n\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park observed the most bats, while Bryce Canyon National Park detected none.\n\n\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park observed the most bats, while Bryce Canyon National Park detected none.\n\n\nI wanted to see each park broken down by protected bat sightings vs. non-protected bat sightings. Except for Bryce Canyon National Park, every place has more sightings of protected bats — a good sign!\n\n\n\nEvery park has more sightings of protected bats than non-protected bats.\n\n\nAccording to the graph below, there are more sightings of protected bats than non-protected species. The national parks are doing a great job protecting their bat populations!\n\n\n\nThe national parks are doing a great job protecting their bat populations!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project makes several inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprise this data set. I was also able to answer the questions first posed in the beginning:\n\nThe vast majority of species were not part of the conservation effort (33,473 vs. 377).\nMammals and birds are the most protected species.\nWhile mammals and birds did not significantly differ in conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles did.\nBats were sighted the most, and they were most likely to be found at Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nThe National Park Service is staunchly involved in the preservation of a variety of environments. National parks are becoming vital biodiversity reserves in the wake of growing global threats. However, we need help to improve and expand biodiversity conservation efforts.\nAccording to the National Park Service, approximately 80 to 90% of living organisms in our national parks remain unknown. Biodiversity discovery activities often require only excited minds and willing hands, not expertise. Children and non-scientists alike can help with conservation efforts. In addition, parks can develop new, engaging relationships with diverse audiences to discover life on our lands.\nPublic involvement and education can yield an exponential increase in awareness of and motivation for stewardship of biodiversity. By working together, we can encourage a public who understands how biodiversity supports the fabric of our lives. We can begin to seed this understanding into our cultural DNA and how we engage with the living world through that knowledge."

So why should mine be any different? With that in mind, I mapped the infection rate by country. First, I took the highest number from the total_cases and divided that by the population. Then, I listed the results per country and fed the results of the new table into Tableau.\n\n\n\nThe darker the color, the higher the infection rate\n\n\nFinally, I wanted to examine the infection rate over time, separated by country. To do so, I used the same query that I did for the map visualization but added date as a criterion.\n\n\n\nThe United States had the highest infection rate as of July 11, 2021."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWhile most of the world’s attention is currently laser-focused on getting vaccines to more people to stem the spread of the coronavirus, vaccines alone will not eliminate the escalation of COVID-19. As a result, scientists have significant pressure to find a cure to help those who contract the virus.\nDoctors have some medications they can use to treat the effects of COVID-19, but developing a drug that targets the virus itself is a complex and costly procedure. More than a year into the pandemic, only one antiviral treatment — remdesivir — is currently recommended for use in the US. Experts say remdesivir is not nearly effective enough, though.\nScientists are hopeful that new drugs designed to stop the virus’ deadly reproduction could reduce hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. In addition, the treatments offer hope and a contingency plan for unvaccinated individuals, particularly in low-income countries lagging far behind in the race to vaccinate."

This approach intrigued me, so I wanted to learn more about it. Maggie Appleton did an excellent job exploring how digital gardens serve as personal knowledge management systems, allowing individuals to cultivate their thoughts and ideas in a non-linear format. There are many benefits to planting and tending to a digital garden, such as fostering creativity, enabling serendipitous discovery, and facilitating knowledge sharing. I found this concept delightful, so I planted my own digital garden.\nBefore this, I had a website I built with Gatsby. I liked that website. The design was a fork of Simplefolio by Jacobo Martínez. I modified the theme’s colors to be more purplish-blue than sea green, changed the font, and added links to my social networks and data analysis projects. It took a while to finish the site, and I wish I documented the process. It served me well when it went live in 2021. However, I started my bachelor’s in Business Analytics program that year, and I started a new job on top of being a busy husband and father. Hence, the site has gone largely untouched since then. Earlier this year, however, I got the itch to rework my website. But what to do? I experimented with Hugo before settling on Quarto as my platform of choice. But why Quarto?"

However, it really boiled down to inspiration, availability, and ease of use.\n\nUpon searching for websites built using Quarto, I was inspired by the myriad of creatives using it to build not only websites but also communities, and I wanted to join the crowd.\nQuarto was already available within RStudio Desktop, a tool I’ve used extensively since starting my bachelor’s program.\nQuarto required little more than a knowledge of RMarkdown to get started. Since I already possessed that, the barrier to entry was low for me."

Instead, I’m going to list where I got my information and inspiration from:\n\nJadey Ryan: Intermediate guide to publish a Quarto website with GitHub & Netlify\n\nThis was my go-to resource while building my site. If you’re interested in using Quarto to plant a digital garden, I highly recommend you start here. I did most of what Jadey outlined, with a few exceptions:\n\nI don’t use Netlify for deployment. I use GitHub Pages.\nI didn’t use usethis.\nWhile I want my garden to be accessible to as many people as possible, I’m not using Lighthouse to audit the accessibility.\n\n\nMarvin Schmitt: Create Your Website with Quarto: Complete Tutorial and Template\n\nI picked up a few tips and tricks here, mainly on adding new pages and deploying with GitHub Pages.\n\nSilvia Canelón\n\nShe inspired me to go repo-diving to learn how things were done on other people’s sites, primarily how she built her contact form1.\n\n\n\nSamantha Csik: Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website\n\nI followed Sam’s guidance in adding a blog (i.e., this section of my garden) to my website.\n\nShe also helped me figure out how to add some pizzazz to my web pages.\n\n\nHilda\n\nHilda is a graphic novel series and an animated television show created by Luke Pearson. It features gorgeous artwork which has been described as “Scandinavia by way of Miyazaki.” Take a look for yourself and I think you’ll get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn entire day in Trolberg"
