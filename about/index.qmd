I'm a [Hudson Valley](https://travelhudsonvalley.com/) resident, but I was born and raised in [Philadelphia](https://www.visitphilly.com/). I live with my wife, son, two dogs, and two cats. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, experiencing music and food, and playing board and video games (❤️ Nintendo). 

I'm a data scientist specializing in K–12 education. I love working in this field because I get to use data and technology to help students succeed while making life easier for the teachers and administrators who support them every day. My biggest passion is building systems that improve student outcomes fairly—without the algorithmic bias that can creep into educational technology.

I graduated from [the State University of New York at New Paltz](https://www.newpaltz.edu/) in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Education in [Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/learning-analytics-AI-online-msed) at the [University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/). The program focuses on utilizing machine learning and AI to develop smarter, more adaptive learning technologies that can identify struggling students early and provide them with support before they fall behind. For my capstone project, I'm developing an early warning system that does precisely that, with a strong emphasis on fairness metrics to ensure it works equitably for all students.

If any of this sounds cool or interesting to you, I'd love to [hear from you](../contact)!
