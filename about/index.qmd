I'm a [Hudson Valley](https://travelhudsonvalley.com/) resident, but I was born and raised in [Philadelphia](https://www.visitphilly.com/). I live with my wife, son, two dogs, and two cats. I enjoy spending time with my family, experiencing music and food, and playing board and video games (❤️ Nintendo).

I'm the School Data Analyst for the <a href="https://www.floridaufsd.org/" title="Florida Union Free School District" target="_blank">Florida Union Free School District</a> (Florida, as in the town in New York, not the state). I like working in education because my talents and skills can improve the quality of teaching and outcomes for many students.

I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.newpaltz.edu/" title="SUNY New Paltz | the State University of New York at New Paltz" target="_blank">State University of New York at New Paltz</a> this spring with a bachelor of science in Business Analytics. It’s been a long row to hoe, and it feels wonderful to have achieved what I set out to accomplish many years ago.

I'd love to [hear from you](../contact)!
